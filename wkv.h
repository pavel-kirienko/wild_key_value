/// Wild Key-Value is a fast and simple single-header key-value container with pattern matching for embedded systems.
/// Keys are strings, and values are void pointers.
/// Keys are stored in the heap in fragments; common prefixes are deduplicated so the memory usage is extremely low.
/// Patterns can be used to look up keys in the container, and also to look up patterns that match a given key;
/// the latter is called "routing".
///
/// WKV can be used with any memory manager that provides realloc. The standard realloc() is suitable, but the
/// recommended memory manager is O1Heap, which offers constant allocation time and low worst-case fragmentation.
///
/// This is the v1 release. When an API-incompatible v2 is published, all definitions will be prefixed with "wkv2"
/// instead of "wkv", and the file will be renamed to "wkv2.h" to ensure safe coexistence with the v1.

/// 1. #0 "123"
