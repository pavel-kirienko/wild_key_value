Please read `README.md` for general information about the project.

If you need a build directory, create one in the project root named with a `build` prefix;
you can also use existing build directories if you prefer so,
but avoid using `cmake-build-*` because these are used by CLion.

Run all tests in debug build to ensure that all assertion checks are enabled.

It is best to use Clang-Format to format the code when done editing.
